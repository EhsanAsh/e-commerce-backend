# Acceptance Criteria

### GIVEN a functional Express.js API,
- *WHEN I* add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file,
*THEN I* am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
- *WHEN I* enter schema and seed commands,
*THEN* a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
- *WHEN I* enter the command to invoke the application,
*THEN* my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
- *WHEN I* open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags,
*THEN* the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
- *WHEN I* test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core,
*THEN I* am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.

# Algorithm:

1. **Start Express.js Application:**
   - Initialize the Express.js application.
   - Establish connection to MySQL using Sequelize and environment variables.
   - Set up and seed the development database with test data.

2. **Expose API Routes:**
   - Develop and expose API routes for categories, products, and tags.
   - Implement CRUD operations for each route.

3. **Server Synchronization:**
   - Start the server.
   - Sync Sequelize models to MySQL database.

## Tasks:

### Development Phase:

- Set up the Express.js application and environment.
- Connect to MySQL database using Sequelize.
- Develop Sequelize models for categories, products, and tags.
- Run schema and seed commands to set up and seed the development database.
- Develop and expose API routes with CRUD operations.
- Start the server and sync Sequelize models.

### Testing Phase:

- Test database connection.
- Test schema and seed commands.
- Test API routes using Insomnia Core.
- Validate CRUD operations for each route.

### Deployment Phase:

- Document setup and usage process.
- Implement error handling and logging.
- Deploy the application ensuring accessibility and functionality.

## Pattern Recognition:

>The workflow follows the typical pattern of developing a backend for an e-commerce website using Express.js and Sequelize, involving the setup, development, testing, and deployment phases. The application provides CRUD functionalities through API routes, allowing interaction with a MySQL database for categories, products, and tags data.
