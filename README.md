## Description
> The E-commerce Backend Application is a Node.js based application designed for internet retail company managers who wish to have a powerful back end for their e-commerce website with the latest technologies. This application allows you to seamlessly connect to a MySQL database using Sequelize, perform schema and seed operations to create and populate a development database with test data, and invoke the application, syncing Sequelize models to the MySQL database. With functional API routes for categories, products, and tags, managers can easily test and manipulate their database content, ensuring their e-commerce platforms are competitive and efficient.
